## Current Pipeline Status

### Current CI/CD Status
- **Pipeline**: No CI/CD configuration detected
- **Build Automation**: Manual build process
- **Testing Integration**: No automated testing
- **Deployment**: Manual deployment process

### Immediate Needs
- Set up automated build pipeline
- Integrate testing into CI process
- Configure deployment automation
- Add security scanning to pipeline


## Recommended Pipeline Architecture

    A[Code Commit] --> B[Build]
    B --> C[Unit Tests]
    C --> D[Integration Tests]
    D --> E[Security Scan]
    E --> F[Deploy Staging]
    F --> G[E2E Tests]
    G --> H[Deploy Production]
```

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Build Stage
- Source code compilation
- Dependency installation
- Asset optimization

### 2. Test Stage
- Unit test execution
- Integration test running
- Code coverage reporting

### 3. Security Stage
- Vulnerability scanning
- Code quality analysis
- Dependency audit

### 4. Deployment Stage
- Staging deployment
- Production deployment
- Rollback capability

## Recommended Tools
- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Azure DevOps
- **Container Registry**: Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Azure App Service, AWS ECS

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up basic CI pipeline
2. Add automated testing
3. Implement security scanning
4. Configure deployment automation
5. Add monitoring and alerting
